# AsciiArtify Kubernetes Deployment Tools Evaluation
## Introduction
Minikube: Minikube is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes locally. It creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

Kind: Kind, short for Kubernetes in Docker, is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”. Kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

k3d: k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run Rancher Lab’s k3s in Docker. k3s is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. With k3d, you can create single-node and multi-node k3s clusters in Docker, for local development on Kubernetes, or as temporary testing environment.
